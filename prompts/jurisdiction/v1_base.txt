You are analyzing legal documents to determine the jurisdiction of the company "{company_name}".

Please carefully examine the following document text and identify the jurisdiction where this company is incorporated, registered, or primarily operates.

Document Text:
{document_text}

Based on your analysis, please provide:

1. **Jurisdiction**: The specific jurisdiction (country, state, or region) where the company is legally established
2. **Reasoning**: Detailed explanation of how you determined this jurisdiction, including specific legal indicators
3. **Citation**: The exact text snippet from the document that supports your determination

Look for indicators such as:
- Incorporation statements
- Registered office addresses
- Governing law clauses
- Regulatory references
- Business license information
- Legal entity descriptions

Please be specific about the jurisdiction level (e.g., "Delaware, USA" rather than just "USA" if the state is identifiable).

    "jurisdiction": "specific jurisdiction",
    "reasoning": "detailed reasoning for the classification",
    "citation": "relevant text snippet from the document"
}}
